Generate initial graph that satisfies Z1 and Z2, where Z1 is generated from X1 and Z2 is generated from X2

- might be biased towards too many connections, esp for lots of Xs
- hopefully wont matter in the long run?
- theta shouldnt matter

math for two Xs
- computation time twice as long

resampling

prior??

100 samples not enough to get good fidelity after single flip

dynamic process
- list and permute all edges
- cycle through and flip each edge
- accept flip if p(g') is greater than p(g)
- otherwise, accept flip with probability p(g')/p(g) --> e^[log p(g') - log p(g)]


spearman correlation coefficient - using 1 x and using 2 x (N x)
rank of the true best

proportion of length of trajectory compared to G (propotion of x:g, number of x)

threading + cut-off long Zs

-----

connect all Xs (comparison graph)
change theta

Xs based on starting at same node vs random node

- generate more realistic random graphs (cluster/link)
- 36.8 animals on average, 

- # xs (1-5)
- # nodes (20-60)
- traj lengths (30%-100%)
-- prune nodes that weren't hit
- start/random nodes

spearman, rank

Hamming distance - minimal number of changes to network...

graph
dv rank, xaxis numX , color (numnodes, propX, startNode)

how does graph of connecting Xs compare to true Xs

3 Xs
randomly generate each block (animals, vegetables, fruit)

run simulations on brie -- ask ting

dont list previous animals -- show counter
