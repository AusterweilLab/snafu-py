# SNAFU: the Semantic Network and Fluency Utility

The semantic fluency task is frequently used in psychology by both reseachers
and clinicians. SNAFU is tool that helps you analyze  fluency data. It can help
with:

<ul>
    <li>Counting cluster switches and cluster sizes</li>
    <li>Counting perseverations</li>
    <li>Detecting intrusions</li>
    <li>Calculating average age-of-acquisition and word frequency</li>
    <li>...more!</li>
</ul>

SNAFU also implements multiple network estimation methods which allow you to
perform network analysis on your data (see <a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-018-0003-7">Zemla &
Austerweil, 2018</a>). These methods are implemented:

<ul>
    <li>U-INVITE networks</li>
    <li>Pathfinder networks</li>
    <li>Correlation-based networks</li>
    <li>Naive random walk network</li>
    <li>Conceptual networks</li>
    <li>First Edge networks</li>
</ul>

<p>SNAFU can be used as a Python library or as a stand-alone GUI. ThePython library is available here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/AusterweilLab/snafu-py">https://github.com/AusterweilLab/snafu-py</a></p>

<p>Or install directly using git (auxilliary files are not included):</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">pip install git+https://github.com/AusterweilLab/snafu-py</code></p>

<p>The Github repository contains several demo files, and a full tutorial is in press (<a href="http://alab.psych.wisc.edu/jzemla/brm.pdf">pre-print</a>). 
tutorial under review. 

<p>A graphical front-end is also available, though it does not contain as many
features as the Python library. You can download it for macOS or Windows. Find
it here:</p>
