Welcome to the SNAFU Demos documentation.

This site provides interactive and programmatic examples for using the SNAFU Python library â€” a toolkit for estimating, analyzing, and visualizing semantic networks, particularly from fluency data.

The `demos` folder includes curated demonstration scripts that showcase how to:

- Estimate semantic networks using U-INVITE and hierarchical U-INVITE models
- Compare generated networks across different participants or conditions
- Reconstruct known semantic structures like those from the University of South Florida norms
- Fit models such as BRM (Bayesian Random Walk) and interpret network behavior
- Compute network-level metrics (e.g., centrality, clustering, connectivity)

These examples are designed to help researchers, analysts, and developers quickly understand how to apply SNAFU to their own datasets and workflows.

Use the sidebar to navigate through the demos, each accompanied by automatic API documentation where available.
