# This file explains how to fit U-INVITE and hierarchical U-INVITE networks

# Q: U-INVITE NETWORK ESTIMATION IS SO SLOW...

# A: That's not really a question, but you're not wrong. Of all the network
# estimation methods implemented in SNAFU, U-INVITE is the most computationally
# intensive. The time needed to fit a network increases ~exponentially with the
# size of the network. Networks with a couple dozen nodes may take 2-30
# minutes, whereas a network with hundreds of nodes could take hours.

# Hierarchical U-INVITE fitting time is affected more by the number of
# participants (since each individual graph is small, but must be estimated
# iteratively many times). For very large datasets, we recommend using
# parallelization, but this implementation is not discussed here as it will
# depend on the system used for parallelization. If you need help, try
# e-mailing snafu-fluency@googlegroups.com and we'll figure something out.

# Q: I CAN'T FIGURE THIS HIERARCHICAL U-INVITE STUFF OUT. ISN'T THERE ANOTHER WAY?

# A: You can use a static prior instead. Instad of fitting all networks at
# once, what this does is only fit one network and assumes the rest of the
# networks are fixed. You can use a set of networks as a prior, or just one
# (such as the USF network or Small World of Words network). This process is
# much much faster and results in better networks, but (of course) this biases
# your network towards whatever you use as a prior. See Example 3 below.

# Q: WHAT IS A DATA MODEL?

# A: The DataModel is a dictionary of parameters that describe assumptions
# about how your fluency data is generated.

# Q: WHAT IS 'FIT INFO'?

# A: The estimation method for U-INVITE is stochastic. This is a dictionary of
# parameters that can be used to adjust the fitting procedure, sometimes
# resulting in faster estimation. Most of the time, you probably want to leave
# this alone, but some of the parameters could be useful when specifying a
# prior.

# Q: DO I NEED TO REMOVE PERSEVERATIONS FROM MY DATA?

# A: By default, U-INVITE assumes a censored random walk that does not produce
# perseverations. You can allow perseverations by changing 'censor_fault' in
# the data model or 'estimatePerseveration' in the fit info

# Q: DOES U-INVITE ALLOW FOR ANY POSSIBLE PAIRWISE TRANSITION?

# A: Some transitions might be impossible given a network, e.g., it might not
# be possible to transition from "dog" to "hippo" because that transition may
# have a zero probability under the U-INVITE model. If you allow for random
# jumps, then any transition will be possible. You can do this by changing the
# 'jump' parameter in the data model.
